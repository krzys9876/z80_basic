# MS Basic Interpreter in Scala #

Work in progress...

Following the Z80 simulator in Scala (https://github.com/krzys9876/z80_sim_scala) i wanted to 
try to write MS Basic interpreter to run similar programs. Just for fun and for practicing 
FP, immutability, class composition and parser combinators.

We'll see what's going to come up from this :)
